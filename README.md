#Book4Blogger


Book style layout for Blogger.com, using Blogger's classic template.
 
The idea to build this template was based on an question from Blogger Help: "[How do I post a book?](http://support.google.com/blogger/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=42323)"

As I like to write poems, I created this template.
